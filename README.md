# ScrollMiles
 A Chrome extension that tracks how far you've scrolled and displays it as real-world distances

You will be able to install this from the chrome web store once it's published, or you can download the folder, go to chrome://extensions in your browser, enable developer mode, click "Load Unpacked" and select the folder.

Also while working on ScrollMiles I made this if you want to try it, https://nullfoo.me/scrollspeed.html it detects scroll speed
